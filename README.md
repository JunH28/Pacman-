# Pacman!
Small hack club project, made on pygame. 

Pacman! is inspired by the existing game, pacman (of course), and the goal is to consume as much cherries as possible. I am still quite new, and I am going to try implement further features such as high scores and etc, but for now, this is all I have to offer. To move the pacman, use the arrow keys on your keyboard, and have fun eating cherries!
